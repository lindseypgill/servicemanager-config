# HAi Automations
## Summarize Request
Using the Requests entity in Hornbill Automations and selecting the Type HAi you will find the Summarize Request task, like the UI for summarizing the request. The only difference here is it being triggered from a workflow. Optionally you can update the request timeline. The summary is also returned as a variable for use in the process later on.

## askHAi
Using the Requests entity in Hornbill Automations and selecting the Type HAi you will find the askHai task. This allows fairly open prompts to be used as part of a Hornbill Workflow. The following example uses the initial summary and description of a request and asks for some clarifying questions to be generated if possible. It's important to not directly send this straight to a user in the first instance and validate its output. As with other automations, the response is optionally added to the timeline and is also returned as a variable for use in the process later on.
