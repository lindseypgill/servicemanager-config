# Users
The list of users helps you view and manage who is using a subscription for Service Manager.  Users can be added and removed from this list to provide or take away access.

## Assigning Users
Provided there are available subscriptions, the `Assign User` button can be used to allocated a subscription to a user.

Adding a user to the list will reserve a subscription for the user.  Service Manager roles will need to be allocated to their user account before they can access the Service Manager app.

## Removing Users
One or more users can be removed from the list by selecting the check-box next to their User ID then clicking on the `Delete` button.

:::note
Removing a user from this list does not remove any assigned Service Manager roles or rights.  It is possible that the subscription is automatically reassigned the next time the user logs in if the setting `subscription.application.allocateOnLogin` is set to `ON`.

## Advanced
